This repository contains the code used to produce the results in "A note on asynchronous Projective Splitting in Julia" by Utkarsh Sharma, Kashish Goel, Aryan Dua, Sebastian Pokutta, and Zev
Woodstock [(preprint)](https://zevwoodstock.github.io/media/publications/asyncprox.pdf).

The subdirectories detail specific experiments on image processing and machine learning (further detailed in the article). The underlying optimisation algorithm used is the 2018 algorithm by Combettes and Eckstein. Instructions to change the algorithm to run it for a different problem are mentioned [(here)](https://github.com/zevwoodstock/AsyncProx/tree/main/Group%20Sparse%20Binary%20Distributed#using-the-library-to-run-a-different-problem).

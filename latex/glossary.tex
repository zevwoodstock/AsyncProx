\begin{description}

\item[Proximal operator] A mathematical operator used in optimization that combines the minimization of a function with a quadratic penalty term. Definition included in the paper.

\item[Block-activated (or block-iterative) algorithm] An algorithm that processes only a subset of the problem components in each iteration.

\item[Asynchronous algorithm] An algorithm where different parts of the computation can proceed independently without waiting for other parts to complete.

\item[Hilbert space] A complete vector space equipped with an inner product.

\item[Lower-semicontinuous function] A function for which the preimage of any open set containing a point in its codomain contains an open set containing the point's preimage.

\item[Latent group lasso] A variant of the lasso regression method that encourages sparsity in groups of variables, even when these groups overlap.

\item[Stereoscopic image recovery] The process of reconstructing a series of related images, typically representing different views of the same scene.

\item[Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)] A mathematical tool for hierarchically decomposing functions or signals.
